# About Me
I are 14 years old guy,who started learning programming in summer 2023.
My first try to learn python is failed.
Then i try to introduce in web,but after time i know,what in my opinion this are boring.
# My not failed attempts to learn programming
My friend sayed me,that i need to learn C#,and after some time I started learning this.
When i ended in learning base of C#,i jumped to C++
I now really don't remember why i should do this,but in process of learning base of C++ my mind had blowed up.
# My main languages
there now are 2 my main languages,in which i write: 
C++ and C#
# My github repositorues
I also have 2 repositories on github,
first written in C++,
second on C#
But i keep this code private,but i don't have a reason why
